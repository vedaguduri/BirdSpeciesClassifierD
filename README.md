# BirdSpeciesClassifierD
A deep learning project for identifying bird species from images using bounding box coordinates.
# Bird Species Classifier

This repository contains a deep learning model designed to classify bird species based on images. The dataset consists of images of 200 bird species, and the model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict the species based on the provided image and bounding box information.

## Project Structure

- **images/**: Contains the train and test images.
- **train.csv**: CSV file containing the training data (image paths, class labels, bounding boxes).
- **test.csv**: CSV file containing the test data (image paths, bounding boxes).
- **model/**: Directory where the trained model will be saved.
- **predictions.csv**: The CSV file generated by the model containing predictions on test images.
- **model_inference.py**: The Python file where model inference and CSV generation code is present.

## Requirements

The code is implemented in Python and requires the following packages:

- `tensorflow`
- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

To install the dependencies, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python pandas matplotlib

## Usage

### 1. Loading the Model

The model should be trained on the dataset before running the predictions. You can either train the model from scratch using the training data or load a pretrained model. 

To load a pretrained model, ensure that you have the model saved as `trained_model.h5` in the `model/` directory.

### 2. Running Predictions

The script will run predictions on the test dataset and generate a `predictions.csv` file with the following format:

```csv
path                  predicted_label   confidence_score
images/test/xx.jpg    1                 0.85
images/test/yy.jpg    2                 0.90
...
```

To run the inference and generate the CSV file, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BirdSpeciesClassifier.git
    cd BirdSpeciesClassifier
    ```

2. Place the test images and `test.csv` file in the appropriate directories.

3. Run the model inference script:
    ```bash
    python model_inference.py
    ```

4. A `predictions.csv` file will be generated in the root directory.

### 3. Submitting Results for Evaluation

Once the `predictions.csv` file is generated, it can be sent to the evaluation server to get the accuracy score.

To submit the predictions for evaluation:

1. Edit the following line in the script with your name and email:

    ```python
    send_results_for_evaluation('your_name', 'predictions.csv', 'your_email')
    ```

2. Run the script and check the accuracy:

    ```bash
    python model_inference.py
    ```

The output will display the model's accuracy returned by the evaluation server.

## Training the Model

If you wish to train the model from scratch:

1. Ensure you have the training data in the `images/train` directory.
2. Modify the `model_training.py` script to train the model.
3. After training, the model will be saved as `trained_model.h5` in the `model/` directory.

```bash
python model_training.py
```
